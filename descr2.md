**Single cell transcriptional profiling of mouse and human immune cells in non-small cell lung cancer**

- **A**. Schematic of experimental workflow for defining and comparing immune transcriptional states in both species. Single cell suspensions for scRNAseq were prepared from patient lung tumor biopsies (n=7), murine lung tumors (n=2), and murine healthy lung tissue (n=2).

- **B**. Two-dimensional visualization (SPRING plots) of immune and non-immune single cell transcriptomes (n= 40,362) in patient lung tumor biopsies (n=7).

- **C, D**. SPRING plots of lung immune cells from (C) human patients (34,450 cells) and (D) mice (15,939 cells). Major cell types were defined by a Bayesian cell classifier using bulk whole-transcriptome profiles of FACS-sorted cell populations.
