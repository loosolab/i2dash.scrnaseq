Plot description:

Sequencing is called *saturated* when generating more sequencing output from a cDNA library does not substantially increase the number of detected features in a sample. Since the number of detected features can act as a technical confounder, and thereby drive substructure in the data, it is advisable to aim for a saturated sequencing by either adding more sequencing output or decreasing the number of samples until saturation is achieved. [@zhang_one_2018] gives advise on how to choose the optimal cell number given a fixed sequencing budget
